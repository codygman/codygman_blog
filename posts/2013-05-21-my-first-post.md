Jekyll/github pages seemed daunting at first, I wish that that [Jekyll Bootstrap](http://jekyllbootstrap.com/) would have been easier to find.
That also led me to the [Jekyll Quickstart page](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/) and all of a sudden things were moving very quickly.
The [Markdown syntax guide at Daring Fireball](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) and [Guide to github flavored markdown](https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown) are very helpful and I'm using them as I type this.

I'm glad I've gotten around to doing this since I've been solving problems I think others my find useful. This blog will be about:

##[Linux](http://linux.org)
- [Debian](http://debian.org) (my primary operation system)
- [Xmonad](http://xmonad.org) (Awesome (haha) tiling window manager I can't live without)

##[Python](http://python.org) (use at work)
```python
    print "I use python at work"
```
- [Django](http://djangoproject.com)
- [Django Rest Framework](http://django-rest-framework.org)

##[Go](http://golang.com) (use at work)
```go
    import "fmt"
    func main() {
        fmt.Println("I use go at work, too ;)")
    }
```
- Web Development
- Game development (hopefully)

##[Racket](http://racket-lang.org)
```racket
    ; I wanted to do something creative like making a self recursive expression
    ; to say "I use racket for fun", but this simple one will have to do.
    (displayln 
        "I primarily use racket for fun and personal projects currently, but that will probably change soon")
```
- Web Development
- Trying to figure out how in the world to implement [Automatically RESTful Web Applications: Marking Modular Serializable Continuations](http://vimeo.com/6627041)

##[Vim](http://vim.org) (use everywhere, including now)
- [My config](http://github.com/codygman/dotvim)
- Most used shortcuts
- New tricks
- Plugins

##[Git](http://git-scm.com)
- Workflows
- Common issues
- Problems I face, and solutions I come up with.

##[Javascript/Ecmascript](http://www.ecmascript.org/)
```javascript
    document.write("Javascript isn't my biggest friend atm, need to read 'The good parts' ;)");
```
- [Angular.js](http://angularjs.org) (Most of my javascript work will probably be in angular)

I've spent far too much time on this and I don't even know if anyone will see it! I think that
covers things for now. I'll be submitting posts which seem interesting/helpful to [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/) for discussion in the future.
Submitting this one seems too 'promotioney' and adds no value imo.
